# Pull requests welcome!  

* Didn't get to finishing the part which associates line numbers with vocabulary so that it's possible to go to and view the various pieces of source code involved.
* Some kind of language-specific plugin system for extracting (e.g.) comments, variable names, function names and class names would be nice. 
* Kubel is hackathon-level code and could do with a prettier UI with a consistent design language. Maybe something like https://material-ui.com .
* Support for multiple input files so that entire repos can be analyzed. 
* ... etc.
